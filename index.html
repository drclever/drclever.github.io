      <p>Jesse Ventura (born James George Janos, July 15, 1951) is an American politician, political commentator, author, actor, and retired professional wrestler who served as mayor of Brooklyn Park, Minnesota, from 1991 to 1995 and the 38th governor of Minnesota from 1999 to 2003. He was the first and only candidate of the Reform Party to win a major government office.</p>

        <p>Ventura was a member of the U.S. Navy Underwater Demolition Team during the Vietnam War.[5] After leaving the military, he embarked on a professional wrestling career from 1975 to 1986, taking the ring name "Jesse 'The Body' Ventura". He had a long tenure in the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) as a performer and color commentator, and was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame class of 2004.[2] In addition to wrestling, Ventura pursued an acting career, appearing in films such as Predator and The Running Man (both 1987).</p>
        
        <p>Ventura first entered politics in 1991 when he was elected mayor of Brooklyn Park, Minnesota, a position he held until 1995. Ventura was the Reform Party candidate in the 1998 Minnesota gubernatorial election, running a low-budget campaign centered on grassroots events and unusual ads that urged citizens not to "vote for politics as usual". In a major upset, Ventura narrowly defeated both the Democratic and Republican nominees. The highest official to ever win an election on a Reform Party ticket, he left the party a year after taking office amid internal fights for control over the party. Since holding public office, Ventura has colloquially called himself a statesman rather than a politician.</p>
